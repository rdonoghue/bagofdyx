        <h1>Crossing Connections</h1>
        <p>
          In <b>Path of the Demon Lord</b>, it is reccomended that characters
          have some sort of tie to the movers and shakers in Crossings. This is
          a little bit handwavey in the text, and in the interest of speeding up
          chargen, I added some selectable/rollable options to append to the
          character creation process to speed it along. I call them
          <b>connections</b> because I have to call them something.
        </p>
        <p>
          To use them, at the end of character creation, the player may choose
          one of their profession categories (Adacemic, Common etc.) and choose
          a connection of that type. They may either pick one of the listed
          connections, or roll for it.
        </p>
