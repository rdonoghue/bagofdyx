        <h1>Work in Progress</h1>
        <p>
          I rotated in as GM for our local weekly game, and I had originally
          hoped to run <b>Shadow of the Weird Wizard</b> out of the kickstarter
          preview material. Unfortunately, while there's preview information on
          the rules, the campaign's not available yet, and a big part of my
          curiosity was around that. So, that was a disappointement, but I had
          gotten sufficiently invested that I decided that I might take a swing
          at <b>Shadow of the Demon Lord</b> (SotDL).
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a lot that I like about the mechanics in SotDL. It's sort of
          a D&D-written-in-shorthand rules system, but the core of the pitch has
          always been than it is designed for short, advancement-centric arcs.
          That is, the default model is an 11 session adventure arc, with
          characters advancing each time. What's more, each level is a genuinely
          interesting step - there are (theoretically) no dead levels. That's
          all some pretty cool stuff!
        </p>
        <p>
          However, the overall theme and tone is less my bag. It is 100%
          grimdark, taking many flavor notes from the classic Warhammer Fantasy
          Roleplay, making it something more akin to a horror game with swords
          than anything else. There are parts of this I like - the fact that the
          arc is going to end badly is kind of neat - and I even enjoy dark
          games like Blades in the Dark, but grimdark has always been a bit too
          much for me. Its over-the-top nature (which serves it well when
          drifting into satire) deflates the sentiment for me.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, while I was resistant, I was curious enough to try to overcome my
          resistance, and I have now put forward SotDL as our next campaign. I
          honestly have no idea how this is going to go, but I'm going all in on
          the experiment.

      The site is a work in progress. Thank you for your patience with the
      jankiness.
