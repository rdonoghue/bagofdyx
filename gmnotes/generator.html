        <h1>The Character Generator</h1>
        <p>
          So, while the <a href="../chargen/index.html">generator</a> is based
          on the SotDL tables, there is absolutely a bit of editorializing to
          it. I more or less tweaked the lists as I entered the data, and when
          an option offered a choice, I tried to have a randomizer make it,
          because it seemed silly not to. A number of the changes are consistent
          enough to bear mention:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If there's a random value in the entry ("You spent 1d6 years in
            prison"), the number is rolled.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the entry has an "or" (you were raise by a Witch or a Druid),
            then it picks one. In appropriate cases - usually from the
            interesting thing list - (You have a small magnet or a silver
            mirror), the entry was split into two entries.
          </li>
          <li>
            I think there was only one of these, but "GM Chooses" entries were
            pulled out.
          </li>
          <li>
            25% of the time, the character will lower one stat by one and raise
            another by one at random.
          </li>
          <li>
            Characters have a preferred "stack" of languages, and if they can
            speak or read & write another language, they'll take the next one
            from the list.
          </li>
          <li>
            If an entry seems like it would give the character an item ("You
            have a sword you took from a fallen warrior") then that item is
            added to inventory. Spotting these entries is entirely manual, so I
            may have missed some.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The thread you may see through these design decisions is the removal
          of choices. This is something I'm generally opposed to at the table,
          but I feel it's in line with the purposes of a generator like this.
          It's a script, not a cop, and if a player wants to take one of these
          and alter it, they can absolutely do that. But the rest of the time,
          the goal is to have something fully formed to look at, either to use
          or as inspiration. Leaving dangling choices undercuts the value of
          hitting the generate button multiple times and seeing what you get.
          That's just opinion, of course, but all software is opinionated, and
          it can be useful to know what those opinions are.
        </p>
        <h2>Current Version</h2>
        <p>
          I don't have numbered releases (yet) and should probably add them. At
          this writing, I have a workable version (on desktop) which can
          generate a character from any of the core 6 ancestries.
        </p>
        <h3>What's Next?</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Get this working on mobile</li>
          <li>Maybe add the comapnion Ancestries?</li>
          <li>General layout cleanup. Try font and size options especially.</li>
          <li>Languages are a bit kludgy. Make them a bit more dynamic.</li>
          <li>
            Turn the recurring Math.floor(Math.random() * array.length) bit into
            a function. I genuinely have no idea why I didn't do that at the
            outset.
          </li>
          <li>Add a note section to indicate stats have been bumped?</li>
          <li>
            Add version numbers and standardize release notes so I don't have to
            paste this list in two places.
          </li>
