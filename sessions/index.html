        <h1>The Campaign</h1>
        <p>
          We're playing the <u>Tales of the Demon Lord</u> adventure path and
          playing it pretty straight
        </p>
        <p>
          The players decided to go with an extended family as their character
          creation rubric, so you have a mixed clan of goblins, dwarves and a
          giant clockwork. The names in the Dyx clan are...pretty much what you
          would expect.
        </p>

        <p>
          Yes, these are my players. Experienced, skilled roleplayers all,
          forcing me to 100% straight face the fact that this whole site is
          built upon the foundation of dyx jokes.
        </p>
        <h1 id="Chars">The Characters</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Unca Notti Dyx - Goblin watchman & trap-maker</li>
          <li>Grabba Dyx - Goblin grave robber & medic</li>
          <li>Holda Dyx - Dwarf chef & sailor</li>
          <li>Bagga Dyx - Dwarf fence, baker & mechanic</li>
          <li>

          </li>
        </ul>

        <h1 id="s1">Session 1: Harvester of Sorrow</h1>

        <p>
          Father Gregory, a well liked and well respected figure in the
          neighborhood, has gone missing, and is one of a number of
          disappearances that have occoured over the course of the past week.
          Worried about Greg, the Dyx Clan starts poking around and askign
          questions, bringing the issue to Private Dyx, a clockwork member of
          the browncoasts who leads them to investigate the good father's
          chapel. This task is complicated by the fact that Private won't fit
          inside, so he investigates by proxy.
        </p>
        <p>
          The investigation bears little fruit (Though Grabba ends up with a
          potion and a scroll, just ot help), but it makes it clear that Greg
          was abducted elsewhere. Thankfully, the crew is pointed to Browncloak
          sergeant who had been investigating the disappearances (and who has
          been put on traffic detail to get her to stop. Private approaches her
          and persuades her to share her notes, which Grabba (The only literate
          one among them) translates. This gives them enough information about
          the disappearances to investigate The Fallen Soldier, a rathole of a
          tavern and the kind of place the Dyx clan is quite cofmortable.
        </p>
        <p>
          It turns out that everyone's a little worried about Greg - he's well
          liked, even if he's a bit of a stick in the mud - and they gather
          enough information to point them at the old Moore House, so the Dyx
          set out.
        </p>
        <p>
          They find themselves interrupted by a pair of gang members,
          encouraging them to keep moving. Words are exchanged, and during the
          face off, Grabba and Notti sneak ahead to look in the house, and see a
          cloaked figure. Further investigation is interrupted as the
          confrontation turns to blows. The gangers are driven off, but in the
          chaos, the cloaked figure slips out of the house, and it's faster than
          the Dyx. however, the know the neighborhood better, and they arrange
          to catch it in a dead end alley.
        </p>

        <h1 id="s1.5">Session 1.5: Harvester of Sorrow concluded</h1>
        <p>Realizing that the creature has left the house unguarded, the Dyx clan abandons their pursuit in order to explore (loot?) the house.  They have a run in with a swarm of diseased rats, which leads to a bit of a melee, but Dyx emerge triumphant.
          </p>
          <p>Exploring the house reveals a secret door to the basement, and they proceed to explore.  In its depths, they find an old iron crypt, the badly injured form of Father Gregory, clinging to his holy symbol. There is also, most critically, a ghoul who is snacking on the not-trival pile of local bodies who looks very interested indeed in this source of fresh meat.</p>
          <p>Combat follows.  Grabba makes every effort to rescue the insensate priest, but between hsi wounds and his trauma, he's of no use.  He also attempts to use the scroll taken from Greg's quarters, but his lack of faith seems to keep anything from happening.</p>
          <p>Sadly, despite heroic efforts, the ghoul absolutely tears through the family, quite gruesomely at points.  The heroic efforts of Private, Grabba  and Bagga Dyx buy time for the others to retreat. Unfortunately, as the fleeing goblins come up from the basement and head towards the exit, the grey cloaked figure returns through the front door.</p>
          <p>Notti & Grabba immediately change directions to dive out the rear window, but the creature is faster than they are.  Notti is cut down while Grabba dives out the window and flees into the city, where the grey cloaked figure eventually hunts him down.</p>

          <p>Trying again with new characters. </p>
